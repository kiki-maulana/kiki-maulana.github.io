  <h1>Healthcare Road Accessibility Map</h1>

  <p>This dataset provides national coverage of healthcare road accessibility in Australia, focusing on access to hospitals and ambulance stations.</p>

  <p>Hospitals are classified into four groups based on the number of clinical services they offer:
    <strong>Blue</strong> (16+ services), <strong>Green</strong> (11–15), <strong>Orange</strong> (6–10), and <strong>Red</strong> (1–5).
    Ambulance stations are included without grouping to support additional access analysis.
  </p>

  <p>Accessibility is calculated using a time-based Network Voronoi Diagram across OpenStreetMap road networks. Estimated travel times are adjusted based on road speed limits and regional driving conditions. Two key accessibility layers are provided:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Road nodes: each showing distance (km) and travel time (hr) to the nearest hospital in each group.</li>
    <li>Sampled residential points: representing population perspectives with linked hospital access metrics.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Travel time accuracy was validated against Google Maps API, showing average discrepancies of:
    <strong>~3 minutes</strong> (urban), <strong>~10 minutes</strong> (regional), and <strong>~90 minutes</strong> (remote areas).</p>

  <p>Aggregated statistics are available at the <strong>SA2</strong>, <strong>LGA</strong>, and <strong>remoteness</strong> levels to support regional comparisons.</p>

  <h2>Interactive Applications</h2>
